# BlackJack_Royale
Text-Based Card Game in Python
   
# **Welcome to the Blackjack game! This is a simple text-based implementation of the classic Blackjack card game using Python.**

## **Game Rules**
# In this game, you'll play against the computer dealer. The goal is to get a higher score than the dealer without exceeding a score of 21.

1. The game starts with each player (you and the dealer) being dealt two cards.
2. Cards 2 to 10 are worth their face value. Jack, Queen, and King are each worth 10 points. An Ace can be worth 1 or 11 points, depending on which value benefits the hand more.
3. Your goal is to get a hand that is closer to 21 points than the dealer's hand, without exceeding 21.
4. If your hand exceeds 21 points, you "bust" and lose the game.
5. If both you and the dealer have the same score, it's a draw.
6. If the dealer has a score of 21 with two cards (Blackjack), they win. Similarly, if you have a Blackjack, you win.
7. The dealer will keep drawing cards until their score is at least 17.
8. You can choose to draw additional cards (hit) or stop drawing (stand).
9. After the game ends, you'll see the results and whether you won or lost.
